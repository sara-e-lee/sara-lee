		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
		<img src="images/About-Section.jpg" alt="me standing in a field of flowers" />
		<p>I am currently a graphic design student at Mt. SAC. Prior to this program, I obtained a Bachelors in Biology at UC Riverside and was also briefly in the veterinary field to become a veterinary technician.</p>
		<p>I started self-teaching myself Adobe Photoshop in 2018 but didn't have much graphic design experience until I enrolled in this program. I am hoping to use my graphic design skills to pursue a career in web design/UI.</p>
